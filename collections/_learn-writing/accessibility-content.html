<h4 class="has-text-primary">As we build products and services for Singaporeans, no one should
    be left behind. Whether it means building public kiosks for those who don't have internet access, ensuring everyone
    can read the content or just saying things in a way that people understand</h4>

<h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Guidelines</h5>
<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), provide an
    international set of guidelines which form the basis of most web accessibility laws in the world.</p>

<h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Implementing Content Design</h5>
<p>Most accessibility principles can be implemented very easily and will not impact the overall "look and feel" of a web
    site.</p>

        </a>
        <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
            <p>For each web page, provide a short title that describes the page content and distinguishes it from other
                pages. The page title is often the same as the main heading of the page.</p>
            <p>Put the unique and most relevant information first; for example, put the name of the page before the name
                of the organization. For pages that are part of a multi-step process, include the current step in the
                page title.</p>

            <p>Write link text so that it describes the content of the link target. Avoid using ambiguous link text,
                such as 'click here' or 'read more'. Indicate relevant information about the link target, such as
                document type and size, for example, 'Proposal Documents (RTF, 20MB)'.</p>

            <p>For audio-only content, such a podcast, provide a transcript. For audio and visual content, such as
                training videos, also provide captions. Include in the transcripts and captions the spoken information
                and sounds that are important for understanding the content, for example, 'door creaks'. For video
                transcripts, also include a description of the important visual content, for example 'Athan leaves the

                unnecessarily technical language. Describe input requirements, such as date formats. Instructions

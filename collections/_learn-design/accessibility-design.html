<h4 class="has-text-primary">As we build products and services for Singaporeans, no one should
    be left behind. Whether it means building public kiosks for those who don't have internet access, ensuring everyone
    can read the content or just saying things in a way that people understand</h4>

<h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Guidelines</h5>
<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), provide an
    international set of guidelines which form the basis of most web accessibility laws in the world.</p>

        <p>Available to the senses (vision and hearing primarily) either through the browser or through assistive
            technologies.</p>
        <p><b>Text alternatives:</b> Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into
            other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language</p>
        <p><b>Time-based media:</b> Provide alternatives for time-based media</p>
        <p><b>Adaptable:</b> Create content that can be presented in different ways</p>
        <p><b>Distinguishable:</b> Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from
            background</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col">

            assistive device.</p>
        <p><b>Keyboard accessible:</b> Make all functionality available from a keyboard</p>
        <p><b>Enough time:</b> Provide users enough time to read and use content, no timing, interruptions can be
            postponed or suppressed by the user except interruptions involving an emergency, when an authenticated
            session expires, the user can continue the activity without loss of data after re-authenticating</p>
        <p><b>Seizures:</b> Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures, nothing that flashes more
            than three times in any one second period</p>
        <p><b>Navigable:</b> Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are, bypass

            pronunciations</p>
        <p><b>Predictable:</b> Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways, consistent navigation, consistent
            identification</p>

<h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Implementing UI Design</h5>
<p>Most accessibility principles can be implemented very easily and will not impact the overall "look and feel" of a web
    site.</p>

    <div class="sgds-accordion-set">
        <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
            <h6>Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background</h6> <i
                class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
        </a>
        <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
            <p>Foreground text needs to have sufficient contrast with background colors. This includes text on images,
                background gradients, buttons, and other elements.</p>
            <p>This does not apply for logos, or incidental text, such as text that happens to be in a photograph.
                Minimum contrast ratio (level AA) should be 4.5:1 and enhanced contrast ratio (level AAA) should be at
                least 7:1.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-set">
        <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
            <h6>Do not use color alone to convey information</h6> <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
        </a>
        <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
            <p>While color can be useful to convey information, color should not be the only way information is
                conveyed.</p>
            <p>When using color to differentiate elements, also provide additional identification that does not rely on
                color perception. For example, use an asterisk in addition to color to indicate required form fields,
                and use labels to distinguish areas on graphs.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-set">

        </a>
        <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
            <p>Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as links and buttons, to make them easy to
                identify. For example, change the appearance of links on mouse hover, keyboard focus, and touch-screen
                activation. Ensure that styles and naming for interactive elements are used consistently throughout the
                website.</p>

        </a>
        <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
            <p>Ensure that navigation across pages within a website has consistent naming, styling, and positioning.
                Provide more than one method of website navigation, such as a site search or a site map. Help users
                understand where they are in a website or page by providing orientation cues, such as breadcrumbs and
                clear headings.</p>

        <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
            <p>Ensure that all fields have a descriptive label adjacent to the field. For left-to-right languages,
                labels are usually positioned to the left or above the field, except for checkboxes and radio buttons
                where they are usually to the right. Avoid having too much space between labels and fields.</p>

            <p>Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission, alerting the user when something
                goes wrong, or notifying the user of changes on the page. Instructions should be easy to identify.
                Important feedback that requires user action should be presented in a prominent style.</p>

            <p>Use whitespace and proximity to make relationships between content more apparent. Style headings to group

        </a>
        <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
            <p>Consider how page information is presented in different sized viewports, such as mobile phones or zoomed
                browser windows. Position and presentation of main elements, such as header and navigation can be
                changed to make best use of the space. Ensure that text size and line width are set to maximize
                readability and legibility.</p>
            <p>Display in a wide window with small text uses multiple columns for primary content, visible navigation
                options, and visible secondary information.</p>
            <p>Display in a narrow window, such as a mobile phone, or with large text uses single column for primary
                content, navigation options are revealed using an icon, and secondary information is also revealed via
                icon.</p>

        <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
            <p>Provide a place in your design for alternatives for images and media. For example, you might need:</p>

<p>Image optimisation is both an art and a science as there is no definitive answer for how to best compress an image
    and there are many well-developed tools that can help reduce the size of an image significantly.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for you to get started:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Prefer vector formats:</b> Vector images are resolution and scale independent, which makes them a perfect fit
        for multi-device and high-resolution world.
    </li>
    <li><b>Pick best raster image format:</b> Determine functional requirements and select the one that suits each
        particular asset.
    </li>
    <li><b>Experiment with optimal quality settings for raster formats:</b> Try with the lower quality settings, the
        results are often very good and byte savings are significant.
    </li>
    <li><b>Serve scaled images:</b> Resize images on the server and ensure that the display size is as close as possible
        to the natural size of an image.
    </li>
</ul>
